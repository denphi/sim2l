"""Version information for sim2l.

Sourced from the installed package metadata via ``importlib.metadata`` so
``pyproject.toml`` remains the single source of truth. The literal fallback
is only used when this module is imported from a working tree that hasn't
been installed (e.g. when running tests directly without ``pip install -e``).
